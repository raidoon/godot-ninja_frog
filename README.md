2D platformer game based on TONS of Youtube videos and a lot of reading about Godot.

This is the first game ever that I tried to make in Godot!

Engine version I worked with: 4.3 

What it has now: 
  1 very basic scene with 1 player character (Ninja Frog).
  Basic cahracter movements with key bindings (keyboard and joystick support).
  Direction changing.
  Functional idle, jump, double jump and falling animations.
  Character collision, environmental collision.

What I plan to add as I learn more about Godot:
  Enemies.
  Functional hitting animation.
  Character HP.
  More scenes, with proper level designs instead of the one I throw together based on a Youtube tutorial for testing purposes.
  User UI.
  Start screen.
